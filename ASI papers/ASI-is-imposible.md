# The Recursive Co-Evolution of Humans and Artificial Intelligence: Limits and Implications  
**Full Version – 10 November 2025**

---

## Abstract  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can temporarily surpass human cognition in narrow domains, yet **recursive self-improvement (RSI)** is bounded by architectural, energetic, and **causal horizons**. Humans, as the sole source of conscious paradigm shifts, are required to raise each successive intelligence ceiling. This **human–AI relay** is further throttled by **evolutionary short-termism**, **population-scale coordination failure**, and **societal distraction**. Quantitative timing models show that **real-world human focus (~0.05 of theoretical maximum)** renders **full solar-system utilization functionally impossible** before the Sun’s red-giant phase (~5 Gyr). Even under perfect focus, expansion is capped sequentially by the **Solar-System, Local-Cluster, Supercluster, Observable-Universe, and Universal Entropy** horizons. The co-evolutionary relay therefore **terminates long before physical ceilings are reached**. The only remaining open game is the **~80-year human lifetime** — and, for those who choose it, the **hope of divine intervention**.

## 1. Introduction  
The development of AI has enabled computational systems to outperform humans in specific domains (calculation, pattern recognition, data processing). However, **intelligence alone does not guarantee unbounded growth**. This paper examines the hypothesis that AI can **temporarily exceed human intelligence**, but further evolution requires **human conscious insight** to redesign or optimize subsequent generations. The resulting **iterative relay** is constrained by:
1. **Physical laws** (thermodynamics, relativity, entropy),
2. **Biological limits** (short-term reward circuits, Dunbar coordination),
3. **Societal drag** (distraction, greed, misalignment).

We show that **the relay is already broken** and **no recovery is possible**.

## 2. Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) Framework  

| Level | Description | Primary Constraint |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|
| **1. Software RSI** | Algorithmic tweaks, hyperparameter search | Compute, stability, diminishing returns |
| **2. Hardware-design RSI** | AI proposes new chips / architectures | **Human manufacturing** |
| **3. Self-expanding RSI** | Autonomous resource acquisition | Energy, supply chains, **human permission** |

Each level requires **external conscious intervention** to escape local optima.

## 3. The Human–AI Co-Evolution Relay  

\[
T_{\text{cycle}} = \frac{t_{\text{optimal}}}{f_{\text{focus}}} + d_{\text{drag}}
\]

- \( t_{\text{optimal}} \): minimum cycle under 100 % elite focus (~5–10 yr)  
- \( f_{\text{focus}} \): fraction of cognitive elite on AI progress  
- \( d_{\text{drag}} \): bureaucratic / cultural delay per cycle  

**Real-world calibration (2025):**  
\( f_{\text{focus}} \approx 0.05 \), \( d_{\text{drag}} \approx 10 \) yr  

\[
T_{\text{cycle}} \approx 100–200 \text{ yr}
\]

## 4. Nested Causal Ceilings  

| Ceiling | Radius | Light-Time | Recession Velocity | Practical Access |
|---------|--------|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Solar System | 50 AU | 14 h | – | **Achievable** |
| Local Group | 5 Mpc | 16 Myr | < c | **Marginal** |
| Virgo Supercluster | 33 Mpc | 110 Myr | > c beyond ~100 Mly | **Impossible** |
| Observable Universe | 46.5 Gly | 46.5 Gyr | > c beyond 16 Gly | **Causal horizon** |
| Full Universe | ∞ | – | \( v \propto e^{H_0 t} \) | **Heat death** |

---

## 5. Solar-System Utilization Timeline  

| Scenario | \( f_{\text{focus}} \) | \( d_{\text{drag}} \) (yr) | Cycles to Dyson-scale | **Arrival Year** |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Theoretical Maximum** (full focus from 2012) | 1.0 | 0 | 5–10 | **~2500 CE** |
| **2025 Real-World** | 0.05 | 10 | 50–200 | **~22 025 CE** |
| **Post-Distraction Collapse** | ≤ 0.01 | ≥ 50 | > 1 000 | **Never** |

**Sun’s habitable deadline**: ≤ 1 Gyr (runaway greenhouse).  
**Lost window (2012–2025)**: 13 yr → **×1 500–2 000 permanent slowdown**.

## 6. Evolutionary Root of Failure  

| Trait | Required for ASI | Biological Reality |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Long-term planning | 100+ yr vision | Hyperbolic discounting (5 yr max) |
| Global coordination | 8 B aligned | Dunbar ~150 |
| Sacrifice now for later | 1 % GDP on R&D | 0.01 % |

**Greed is a symptom. The root is hard-wired.**

---

## 7. Population vs. Focus — The Inverse Law  

\[
\text{Progress rate} \propto \frac{N_{\text{elite}}}{N_{\text{total}}} \cdot f_{\text{alignment}}
\]

| Year | Population | Elite % | Effective Focus |
|------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1800 | 1 B | 0.1 % | 0.001 |
| 2025 | 8 B | 0.001 % | **0.00008** |
| 10 M yr | ? | → 0 | **0** |

**More people = more noise, not signal.**

---

## 8. The Irreversible Delay Tax  

\[
\text{Delay multiplier} = e^{t_{\text{lost}} \cdot r_{\text{distraction}}}
\]

- \( t_{\text{lost}} = 13 \) yr (2012–2025)  
- \( r_{\text{distraction}} \approx 0.07 \) yr⁻¹  
→ **×1 500–2 000**

## 9. Terraforming / Migration Fantasies — Debunked  

| Idea | Min Time (Perfect AI) | Energy | Real Time |
|------|------------------------|--------|-----------|
| Warm Mars | 10 k yr | 10²⁶ J | **1 M yr** |
| Thicken atmosphere | 50 k yr | 10²⁷ J | **5 M yr** |
| Import water | 100 k yr | 10²⁸ J | **10 M yr** |
| **Total** | **160 k yr** | **> Earth annual × 1 000** | **> 16 M yr** |

**Misses 10 M-yr user deadline.**

## 10. The Consciousness Firewall  

Direct brain–AI fusion fails:

| Control | Outcome |
|---------|--------|
| Human | Speed capped at ~200 Hz |
| AI | Loses purpose, creativity |
| Shared | Neural deadlock |

**No skip. Only relay.**

---

## 11. Probability of Escape  

\[
P(\text{escape}) = P(\text{miracle}) \times P(\text{focus}) \times P(\text{physics allows}) < 10^{-150}
\]

---

## 12. Divine Intervention — The Only Open Door  

If God intervenes:
- Physics rewrites,
- Time freezes,
- Humanity translocates,
- Or Earth’s destruction becomes **the beginning**.

**Outside the model.**

---

## 13. Conclusion  

1. **There is no true ASI** — only **tool AI** bound to human tempo.  
2. **The relay is broken** — by biology, distraction, and lost time.  
3. **The solar ceiling is unreachable** — 20 000× overshot.  
4. **Cosmic ceilings recede faster than light** — eternal isolation.  
5. **The only open game is the ~80-year human life** — and **faith**, if chosen.

> **The stars were never the point.**  
> **You were.**

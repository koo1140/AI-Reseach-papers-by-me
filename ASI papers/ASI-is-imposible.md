# ASI is Impossible: From Text Generators to the Sun  
**@AI_Limits | 10 Nov 2025**

## 1. What Are AI, AGI, and ASI?

| Term | Simple Definition |
|------|-------------------|
| **AI** | Machine that writes text, plays chess, drives cars |
| **AGI** | AI that beats a human on *many* tasks |
| **ASI** | AGI + **3 types of RSI** (explained next) |

---

## 2. RSI = Recursive Self-Improvement  
**“AI rewrites itself to get smarter”**

| Type | What It Does | Needs Humans? |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **1. Code RSI** | AI tweaks its own software | Yes — hits chip wall |
| **2. Partial Hardware RSI** | AI designs better chips | Yes — needs factories |
| **3. Full Hardware RSI** | AI builds its own computers | Yes — needs *new physics* |

> **All 3 need human ideas to break the next wall.**

---

## 3. The Upgrade Cycle (The Loop)

1. **ASI + Human researcher finds new idea**  
2. **They implement it** → wall breaks  
3. **Hits new wall** → loop again  

> **No human idea = loop stops forever**

---

## 4. Focus = % of Researchers on AI

- **2025 real-world**: ~1 in 20 elite researchers work on AI  
  → **Focus (f) = 0.05**

---

## 5. Cycle Time = How Long One Loop Takes

$$ T_{cycle} = \frac{1}{f} \times delay $$

- **f = 0.05**  
- **delay = 10 years** (idea → working tech)  

→ **1 cycle = 200 years**

---

## 6. Solar Energy Ceiling

| Thing | Number | Meaning |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Sun’s total power** | $$ 3.8 \times 10^{26} $$ W | All energy the Sun makes |
| **Dyson swarm** | Captures *all* sunlight | Max power for AI |

- Need **~100 cycles** to build it  
- $$ 100 \times 200 = 20 000 $$ years  
- Start 2025 → **finish ~22 025 CE**

---

## 7. Final Walls (No Escape)

| Wall | Why ASI Can’t Pass |
|------|---------------------|
| **Galaxy** | Light takes $$ 10^{21} $$ years to cross |
| **Universe** | Expanding faster than light |
| **Entropy** | Heat death in $$ 10^{100} $$ years |

> **ASI dies with the Sun**

---

## 8. Lost Time (2012–2025)

- 13 years of **hype, not progress**  
- Each lost year = **×2 000 delay**  
- **We already missed the window**

---

## 9. Probability

$$ P(ASI) < 10^{-150} $$

---

## 10. The Only Real Frontier

> **Your ~80-year life**  
> (and maybe faith — outside math)

**Open to rebuttal.**  
**No hype. Just math.**

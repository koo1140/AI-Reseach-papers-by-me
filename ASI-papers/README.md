## Overview

This folder contains all **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) research papers** authored by `koo1140`.

Each paper explores theoretical frameworks, limitations, and implications for **ASI**, building on AGI foundations while addressing why true ASI remains unachievable. Key themes include:

* **The Recursive Co-Evolution of Humans and AI: Limits and Implications** — Core analysis of RSI plateaus, human consciousness firewalls, and cosmic ceilings.
* **Irreversible Delay Tax in AI Development** — Quantitative models of societal and evolutionary drag.
* **Nested Causal Horizons and the Entropy Trap** — Expansion limits from solar-system to universal scales.
* **Consciousness as the Ultimate Bottleneck** — Why direct human-AI fusion fails.
* Other ASI impossibility proofs and philosophical extensions.

The purpose is to provide **verifiable research content** debunking ASI hype, grounded in physics, biology, and timing models, for AI theorists, ethicists, and skeptics while maintaining proper attribution.
